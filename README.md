Multiple Counter Project

Language:

Java

Explanation:

This program counts how many numbers in a given list are multiples of each number from 1 to 9.


We first store the input list of numbers in an array.

We use a HashMap to keep track of counts for each divisor from 1 to 9.

For every number in the list, we check divisibility with each divisor d .

If the number is divisible we increment the count for that divisor in the map.

Finally we print the result in the form count.
